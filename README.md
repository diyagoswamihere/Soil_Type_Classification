# Soil_Type_Classification
🌱 Soil Type Classification Using MobileNetV2
This project implements a soil type image classification system using MobileNetV2 with transfer learning. It aims to accurately identify various soil categories from images using deep learning techniques.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes labeled images of different soil types. The dataset is split manually into training and validation sets with an 80-20 ratio.

🧠 Model Architecture
Base Model: MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
Custom Layers:
-Global Average Pooling
-Dense Layer with ReLU activation
-Dropout for regularization
Final Dense Layer with Softmax activation for multi-class classification

🔁 Data Augmentation
Utilized ImageDataGenerator to apply:
Rotation
Width/height shift
Zoom
Horizontal flip
This increases model generalizability and performance on unseen images.

🧪 Training Details
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam
Callbacks:
-EarlyStopping
-ReduceLROnPlateau
ModelCheckpoint (best model saving)

📈 Evaluation Metrics

Visual plots of model performance

📊 Visualization
Training and validation accuracy/loss are plotted to observe overfitting or underfitting. Model performance is evaluated on validation data.

🛠 Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
KaggleHub

📌 Future Improvements
Extend to more soil categories.
Deploy model via a web/mobile app for farmers or agronomists.
Improve accuracy with advanced ensemble methods or transformers.
